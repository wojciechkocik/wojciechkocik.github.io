                👋 Hi, I’m Wojciech Kocik.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have >⓼ years of commercial experience in software engineering 👨🏻‍💻.

            <p>
                Computers have been always my hobby, as a young boy I was curious how things work
                👀, I
                loved to disassembling all devices 😄.
                I am lover of every kind of technology ♥, everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from being a geek 🤓 I enjoy travelling ✈️, fast cars 🚙‍️, mountain biking 🚵️
                and
                skiing ⛷️. Healthy work-life balance is essential for me.

                My favorite motto? 📚
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly
                    satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work
                    is to love what you do.
